# Tiberius - GM Only Information

## Hidden Background & True Motivations

### The Debt That Binds
Tiberius was never a successful merchant. Twenty years ago, he was a failing trader on the verge of debtor's prison when Senator Valerius Corvus offered him a deal: become the senator's proxy in the gladiatorial trade. Corvus provided the capital to purchase the Ludus Ferrata, and in return, Tiberius serves as the public face while Corvus pulls the strings from the shadows. Tiberius owns nothing—it all belongs to Corvus. His wealth, his ludus, even his life exists at the senator's pleasure.

### Real Goals
- **Survival:** Above all else, Tiberius must keep Senator Corvus satisfied or risk losing everything
- **Independence:** Secretly dreams of true ownership and freedom from Corvus's control, but knows this is likely impossible
- **Self-Preservation:** Will sacrifice anyone, including his gladiators, to protect his position
- **Legacy:** Paradoxically, despite not truly owning the ludus, he has come to care about its reputation as an extension of his own identity

### Psychological Profile
Tiberius lives in constant fear masked by an authoritative facade. He has internalized his role so thoroughly that he sometimes forgets he's merely a puppet. This creates cognitive dissonance—he takes pride in "his" ludus while knowing he could lose it all in an instant. This makes him paranoid, prone to seeing threats everywhere, and willing to preemptively eliminate anyone who might discover his secret or threaten his arrangement with Corvus.

## What Tiberius Knows

### About the Sponsors
- Knows that several prominent sponsors are locked in a power struggle for control of arena politics
- Understands that Senator Corvus is manipulating gladiatorial matches to influence political outcomes
- Aware of specific bribes and arrangements between sponsors and arena officials (could be used as blackmail if he were desperate)
- Knows which sponsors are drowning in debt and using arena matches to gamble their way out

### About the Arena System
- Understands the fixed matches and staged outcomes that occur regularly
- Knows which referees and officials can be bribed
- Aware of the underground network that smuggles information, weapons, and contraband in and out of the ludus
- Has connections to healers who can ensure gladiators recover quickly—or don't recover at all

### About the PCs
Tiberius keeps detailed records on every gladiator. For PCs specifically:
- Their fighting styles, weaknesses, and psychological vulnerabilities
- Any debts, family connections, or leverage points that could be exploited
- Their value in terms of betting odds and audience appeal
- Whether they pose a threat to his arrangement with Corvus
- Which PCs might be useful as tools or scapegoats in future schemes

## Leverage Over PCs

### Direct Control
- Can assign PCs to death matches or favorable exhibition bouts
- Controls their access to quality equipment, medical care, and training resources
- Can separate allies or force PCs to fight each other
- Holds power over any loved ones or family members still in the city (through Corvus's network)

### Indirect Manipulation
- Can spread rumors about PCs to sponsors, affecting their market value
- May offer conditional "paths to freedom" that are actually traps or tests from Corvus
- Can use information about fixed matches as bait—offering to help PCs win, then using that conspiracy as blackmail
- Might approach a PC privately to act as an informant on other gladiators in exchange for better treatment

## Mid/Late Campaign Potential

### Escalating Desperation
As Senator Corvus's political situation becomes more precarious (mid-campaign), Tiberius will become increasingly erratic and dangerous. He may:
- Stage gladiator "accidents" to prevent information from leaking
- Attempt to use PCs as pawns in Corvus's political schemes
- Become paranoid that PCs have learned his secret, leading to preemptive strikes
- Seek to eliminate any gladiator who has become too independent or influential

### Betrayal Hooks

**The Desperate Alliance (Mid-Campaign)**
When Corvus demands Tiberius sacrifice popular gladiators (including PCs) for a political maneuver, Tiberius might approach PCs secretly, offering to help them escape or "disappear" if they help him break free from Corvus. This is either genuine desperation or a test of loyalty orchestrated by Corvus.

**The Frame Job (Late-Campaign)**
Tiberius could frame a PC for a crime (murder of a rival gladiator, theft, conspiracy against a sponsor) to deflect attention from his own schemes or to appease Corvus's demands for a scapegoat.

**The Final Gambit (Campaign Climax)**
If Corvus falls from power, Tiberius must decide: flee the city, attempt to seize true control of the ludus, or throw himself on the mercy of Corvus's enemies by offering damning testimony. PCs might be caught in the crossfire or positioned to exploit this chaos.

### Redemption Possibility?
It's possible—though difficult—for PCs to turn Tiberius against Corvus if they:
- Discover concrete evidence of the arrangement
- Offer protection from Corvus's retaliation
- Appeal to his pride and genuine affection for the ludus
- Convince him that Corvus plans to discard him anyway

This would be a high-risk, high-reward move requiring significant character development and careful planning.

## Sacrifice Scenarios

### Tiberius as Sacrificial Lamb
If PCs need someone to take the fall for a larger conspiracy, Tiberius is perfectly positioned:
- Has enough authority to be believable as a mastermind
- Is actually guilty of numerous crimes
- His downfall would satisfy both the public and political rivals
- Corvus would willingly sacrifice him to protect himself

### Tiberius Sacrifices PCs
Conversely, if Corvus demands blood, Tiberius will not hesitate to throw PCs to the wolves:
- Stage a "training accident" or "escape attempt" that justifies execution
- Arrange matches designed to kill specific gladiators
- Sell PCs to particularly cruel sponsors or distant arenas where they'll disappear
- Frame them for crimes that require capital punishment

## Twist Potential

### The Double Agent
Tiberius isn't just working for Corvus—he's been secretly feeding information to one of Corvus's political rivals in hopes of engineering the senator's downfall and seizing the ludus for himself. This makes him even more dangerous and unpredictable.

### The Bastard Son
Tiberius is actually Corvus's illegitimate son, and their relationship is far more complex than business. This adds psychological depth: Tiberius seeks his father's approval while resenting his control, and Corvus genuinely cares for Tiberius but expresses it through manipulation and control.

### The Regretful Father
Tiberius has a child of his own (hidden away, perhaps a gladiator in another ludus or city) and will do anything to protect them from Corvus discovering this vulnerability. PCs discovering this secret could provide leverage—or make Tiberius even more dangerous.

## Roleplaying Notes

### In Player Interactions
- Cold and businesslike, rarely shows emotion
- Speaks of gladiators as "assets" and "investments"
- Occasionally slips and shows genuine pride in the ludus's achievements
- Becomes hostile if questioned about his past or pressed about his relationship with Corvus
- Watches PCs carefully during conversations, assessing their value and threat level

### Tells and Vulnerabilities
- Drinks more heavily when stressed about Corvus's demands
- His right hand trembles slightly when lying about ownership or autonomy
- Becomes defensive and aggressive when PCs demonstrate too much independence
- Shows uncharacteristic generosity when trying to manipulate someone
- Avoids being alone with gladiators he considers dangerous or too perceptive

### Potential Character Arc
Tiberius could evolve from antagonist to reluctant ally to tragic figure, depending on PC choices and campaign direction. His journey could mirror the PCs' struggle for freedom, creating a dark parallel: what happens when you achieve material success but remain enslaved?

**GM Note:** Tiberius works best as a complex antagonist rather than a simple villain. His fear, pride, and desperation make him dangerous, but also potentially sympathetic. Use him to explore themes of freedom, agency, and the different cages that bind people—some made of iron, others of debt and obligation.
