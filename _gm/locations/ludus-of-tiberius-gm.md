**Type:** Ludus (GM-Only Information)

## Secret Vulnerabilities

### Structural Weaknesses
- **The Old Cistern:** Beneath the infirmary is a collapsed Roman cistern from before the ludus was built. The floor has subtle cracks, and a determined escape attempt could break through into ancient tunnels that connect to the city's old sewers.
- **The East Wall:** A section of the compound wall near the cells was poorly repaired after an earthquake three years ago. The mortar is weak, and a coordinated escape could bring it down with enough force or the right tools.
- **The Armory Lock:** The heavy padlock on the armory is old and can be picked by anyone with lockpicking skill and proper tools. The hinges also rust in the rainy season, potentially making them vulnerable to being forced.

### Security Gaps
- **Guard Rotation:** The night watch rotates every four hours. During the changeover (midnight and 4 AM), there's a 10-15 minute gap where the yard is less observed. Smart gladiators have noticed this.
- **Alexios the Physician:** The Greek doctor is sympathetic to the gladiators and can be convinced to smuggle messages, small items, or provide alibis—for the right price or compelling story.
- **Delivery Times:** Food and supplies arrive at dawn three times per week. The gate is opened, and chaos ensues. Quick-thinking gladiators could slip contraband in or out, or even plan something more dramatic.

## Tiberius's Private Arrangements

### Financial Troubles
Tiberius is deeply indebted to **Senator Marcus Corvus**, who loaned him gold to purchase several expensive fighters two years ago. The senator now holds the ludus deed as collateral. Tiberius must produce winning gladiators and profitable matches, or Corvus will seize the school and sell it—and all its fighters—to a rival lanista known for brutality.

**Campaign Hook:** If the gladiators earn enough victories, they could secure Tiberius's financial freedom and earn genuine loyalty from their owner. Alternatively, they could learn of this debt and use it as leverage.

### Secret Deals
- **Fixed Matches:** Tiberius occasionally arranges for matches where outcomes are pre-determined in exchange for bribes from sponsors or wealthy patrons betting on the games. He hates doing this but sees it as necessary for survival.
- **Selling Information:** Tiberius trades information about rival ludii and their fighters to sponsors, giving his own gladiators an edge but making enemies among other lanistae.
- **The Senator's Spy:** One of the gladiators—or possibly a trainer—is secretly reporting to Senator Corvus about Tiberius's activities. The identity of this spy is unknown even to Tiberius, creating paranoia.

### Tiberius's True History
Tiberius earned his freedom after 15 years in the arena, fighting for a cruel lanista named Quintus. When Quintus died, Tiberius used his saved winnings and a loan to purchase the ludus from Quintus's widow. He vowed never to treat his fighters as Quintus treated him—but debt and pressure from powerful men have forced compromises that haunt him.

**Secret:** Tiberius once killed another gladiator outside the arena in a drunken brawl. Senator Corvus knows this secret and uses it as additional leverage.

## Hidden Rumors (Investigation Required)

These rumors are true but not common knowledge:

- **The Ghost Fighter:** Twenty years ago, a champion gladiator named Valerius supposedly won his freedom and vanished. In truth, he was murdered by Quintus (Tiberius's former owner) for knowing too much about fixed matches. His body is buried beneath the shrine. His spirit is said to walk the cells on the nights before major games.
  
- **The Physician's Past:** Alexios is not just a physician—he's a former scholar who fled Athens after being accused of poisoning a political rival. He knows dozens of toxic and medicinal recipes and could easily kill or incapacitate anyone in the ludus if motivated.

- **The Secret Cache:** Old Decimus, the shrine keeper, maintains a hidden cache of weapons, tools, and coin beneath the altar to Mars. It's a "freedom fund" gathered from offerings over decades, intended to help gladiators who earn their release. Only Decimus knows of it, and he'll only reveal it to someone he judges worthy.

- **The Arena Architect's Daughter:** Tiberius is secretly in love with a patrician woman named Livia, daughter of the arena's chief architect. Their affair is forbidden—she is betrothed to another patrician—but they meet in secret. If discovered, Tiberius could lose everything.

## Possible Events and Scenes

### Midnight Conspiracy
The gladiators discover the weak point in the east wall and plan an escape attempt. Do they risk it? Do they tell Tiberius in exchange for rewards? What if the spy reports them first?

### The Physician's Offer
Alexios approaches the PCs with a proposal: he'll provide them with a sleeping poison to use in an upcoming match in exchange for help smuggling letters to a contact in the city. What is Alexios really planning?

### Senator Corvus Visits
The senator arrives unannounced to inspect "his investment." He treats the gladiators like animals, tests Tiberius's authority in front of everyone, and hints that he might seize the ludus soon. How do the PCs react?

### Fixed Match Revealed
The PCs are told to "lose convincingly" in an upcoming match for a large payout. Do they obey Tiberius? Do they expose the corruption? What are the consequences either way?

### Rival Ludus Attack
A rival lanista, angry about Tiberius's information-selling, sends thugs to sabotage the ludus—poisoning the well, setting fire to the armory, or worse. The gladiators must defend their home.

### The Shrine's Secret
During a desperate moment, Old Decimus reveals the hidden cache to a worthy PC. What will they do with this knowledge? Use it for themselves? Share it with others? Try to buy their freedom?

### Livia's Plea
Tiberius's secret lover Livia arrives in disguise, begging for his help. Her father has been falsely accused of corruption, and she needs someone brave—and expendable—to retrieve evidence from a dangerous location. Tiberius asks the PCs to do this favor. What's really going on?

## Campaign Evolution

### If the PCs Succeed Often
- Tiberius pays off Senator Corvus and regains control of the ludus
- He becomes more generous, offering better equipment, freedoms, and genuine respect
- The ludus's reputation grows, attracting better matches and more dangerous rivals
- Tiberius may offer to help PCs earn their freedom through legitimate victories

### If the PCs Struggle or Fail
- Senator Corvus seizes the ludus and sells it to a brutal lanista named Lucius
- Conditions worsen dramatically—starvation rations, brutal punishments, suicide matches
- Tiberius might be imprisoned or exiled, leaving the PCs without their "fair" master
- The PCs must either escape, survive worse conditions, or somehow reclaim their former situation

### If the PCs Discover Secrets
- Learning about the fixed matches could lead to blackmail, extortion, or using the information to gain leverage
- Finding the escape route or weapons cache opens new options for freedom
- Discovering the spy creates paranoia and potential faction splits among the gladiators
- Revealing Tiberius's affair could destroy him—or give the PCs leverage over both Tiberius and Livia's family

### Long-Term Possibilities
- The ludus could become a safe haven and home base if the PCs earn enough freedom and respect
- It could be destroyed by enemies, forcing the PCs to find new patrons
- The PCs might eventually purchase the ludus themselves if they win their freedom and enough wealth
- A major arena disaster or political upheaval could free all the gladiators at once, changing the campaign entirely

## GM Notes

**Tone:** The ludus should feel like both a prison and a community. The gladiators are trapped, but they form bonds with each other and even some of the staff. Tiberius is not evil—he's a man caught between his ideals and the brutal reality of his debts and society.

**Secrets as Currency:** Don't reveal everything at once. Let the PCs discover secrets through investigation, eavesdropping, building relationships, and making tough choices. Each secret discovered should open new story possibilities.

**Moral Complexity:** Tiberius makes questionable choices, but he has reasons. The physician is sympathetic but also selfish. Even Senator Corvus has motivations beyond simple villainy (protecting his investment, maintaining social standing). Let players decide who to trust.

**The Ludus as Home:** Even if the PCs hate being enslaved, the ludus becomes familiar. Use NPCs, routines, and small kindnesses to make the compound feel real. This makes potential threats to it more meaningful and escape attempts more bittersweet.
