## Overview: The Favor System

The Sponsor Favor mechanic serves multiple campaign functions:
1. **Progression tracker** - Measures gladiator advancement toward freedom
2. **Resource economy** - Creates meaningful choices about spending vs. saving
3. **Story anchor** - Ties characters to their sponsors and political intrigue
4. **Pacing tool** - Helps GMs control campaign arc progression

This guide contains the full mechanical framework, pacing guidance, and adjudication notes for running the Favor system.

## Core Mechanics

### Favor Scale

Favor is tracked as an integer value, typically ranging from -20 to +100 for a full campaign:

| Range | Status | Sponsor Attitude | Campaign Phase |
|-------|--------|------------------|----------------|
| -20 to -10 | Crisis | Considering selling/executing you | Critical |
| -9 to 0 | Disfavor | Disappointed, watching closely | Warning |
| 1 to 15 | Neutral | Neither impressed nor concerned | Early Campaign |
| 16 to 35 | Favor | Pleased with progress | Mid Campaign |
| 36 to 60 | High Favor | Very pleased, increasing investment | Advanced Campaign |
| 61 to 80 | Exceptional | Invaluable asset, trusted confidant | Late Campaign |
| 81 to 100 | Legendary | Rudis consideration, legendary status | Endgame |

**Starting Favor:** Characters typically begin with 8-12 Favor (Neutral, with room to prove themselves).

## Pacing and Campaign Arc

### Target Progression

For a typical 15-20 session campaign reaching rudis eligibility:

**Sessions 1-5 (Early Campaign):**
- Expected Range: 8-25 Favor
- Focus: Establishing competence, surviving initial bouts
- Key Milestone: Reach 15+ Favor (solid standing)

**Sessions 6-10 (Mid Campaign):**
- Expected Range: 20-45 Favor
- Focus: Building reputation, deeper political involvement
- Key Milestone: Reach 35+ Favor (valued asset)

**Sessions 11-15 (Late Campaign):**
- Expected Range: 40-70 Favor
- Focus: Championship bouts, major political stakes
- Key Milestone: Reach 60+ Favor (exceptional standing)

**Sessions 16-20 (Endgame):**
- Expected Range: 60-90 Favor
- Focus: Rudis consideration, final arcs
- Key Milestone: 80+ Favor qualifies for rudis consideration

### Pacing Control

**If players are accumulating Favor too quickly:**
- Introduce passive sinks (sponsor's political troubles)
- Create expensive opportunities requiring Favor spending
- Increase difficulty of matches (victories worth same but harder to achieve)
- Add tempting Favor expenditures (rescue opportunities, political intrigue)

**If players are struggling to gain Favor:**
- Provide bonus opportunities (sponsor missions with clear rewards)
- Reduce passive sinks temporarily
- Offer easier victories against named opponents
- Create roleplay scenarios with guaranteed small Favor gains

**If players hoard Favor without spending:**
- Introduce urgent needs (medical emergency, threatened ludus-mate)
- Create time-sensitive opportunities where spending Favor opens story paths
- Have sponsor suggest spending on development ("You'll need better gear for what's coming")
- Show NPCs spending their Favor to succeed (model the behavior)

## Rudis Eligibility

The rudis (wooden sword of freedom) represents the ultimate campaign goal. Eligibility requirements:

### Minimum Thresholds

- **Favor:** 80+ (can be lower if extraordinary circumstances)
- **Victories:** 15+ arena victories (at least 10 as featured combatant)
- **Legendary Status:** Well-known reputation (in-game recognition)
- **Sponsor Trust:** No serious transgressions in recent history (past 5 sessions)

### Additional Factors

- **Political Timing:** Sponsor must be in stable/strong political position
- **Campaign Investment:** Sponsor has profited from gladiator's success
- **Story Readiness:** Character arcs approaching satisfying conclusion
- **Replacement:** Sponsor has another promising gladiator to replace them

### Rudis Process

1. **Eligibility Conversation:** GM hints that rudis consideration is approaching
2. **Champion Bout:** Final major arena victory required
3. **Sponsor Decision:** Roleplay scene where rudis is offered
4. **Public Ceremony:** Freedom granted before the crowd
5. **New Chapter:** Character either continues as free agent or retires

**Note:** Rudis grants freedom but not necessarily wealth. Many freed gladiators remain involved with their former sponsor as paid champions, trainers, or political agents.

## Sample Adjudication Scenarios

### Scenario: Spectacular Combat

**Situation:** Gladiator defeats opponent using acrobatic leap, disarm, and theatrical surrender demand that the crowd loves.

**Adjudication:**
- Base victory: +3 Favor (solid win)
- Theatrical combat (2 rounds of showmanship): +2 Favor
- Disarm: +2 Favor
- Crowd approval: +2 Favor
- **Total: +9 Favor**

### Scenario: Political Mission

**Situation:** Sponsor asks gladiator to deliver message to rival house, potentially dangerous.

**Adjudication:**
- Mission success: +5 Favor
- Handled diplomatically: +2 Favor
- Discovered rival's secret: +3 Favor
- **Total: +10 Favor**

**If Failed:**
- Mission failure: -4 Favor
- If caused scandal: -3 additional Favor
- **Total: -7 Favor**

### Scenario: Requesting Major Equipment

**Situation:** Gladiator at 35 Favor requests enchanted weapon worth 12 Favor.

**Adjudication:**
- Approve if: Recent victory (within 2 sessions), upcoming important bout, or compelling story reason
- Cost: 12 Favor (new total: 23 Favor)
- Suggest earning more first if: No clear need, player hoarding otherwise, or want to maintain tension

### Scenario: Defying Orders

**Situation:** Sponsor orders gladiator to throw a fight. Gladiator refuses and wins spectacularly.

**Adjudication:**
- Victory: +8 Favor (would normally gain)
- Defying direct orders: -10 Favor
- **Net: -2 Favor** (plus potential political complications)
- Consider: Does sponsor respect the defiance? Could add +2 to +4 back if it actually helps their reputation
- Story consequence: Sponsor relationship becomes complicated

## GM Tips and Best Practices

### Communication

- **Transparency:** Tell players their current Favor and general thresholds
- **Feedback:** Explain major Favor gains/losses when they occur
- **Expectations:** Let players know what range is "good" for their progress level

### Flexibility

- **Adjust to Table:** Some tables want mechanical rewards, others want story
- **Pace for Campaign Length:** Adjust progression if campaign will be shorter/longer than planned
- **Character Focus:** Some PCs might prioritize Favor, others might not—both are valid

### Story Integration

- **Make It Personal:** Sponsor NPCs should have personality and goals
- **Consequences:** Low Favor should have stakes (not just numbers)
- **Opportunities:** High Favor should open story doors, not just mechanical benefits

### Balance

- **Don't Punish Creativity:** If players find unexpected ways to gain Favor, reward ingenuity
- **Avoid Grinding:** Favor should come from dramatic moments, not repetitive actions
- **Meaningful Choices:** Players should sometimes have to choose between Favor and other goals

### Endgame Considerations

- **Multiple Paths:** Not every character needs to reach rudis (some might have other goals)
- **Timing:** Coordinate rudis eligibility with campaign finale arcs
- **Beyond Freedom:** Consider what comes after rudis (new adventures, retirement, tragedy?)

---

**Remember:** Favor is a tool to enhance your campaign, not a rigid system. Adjust values, pacing, and requirements to serve your story and player enjoyment. The goal is meaningful progression toward freedom, not mathematical perfection.

*The sponsor holds the chains, but the gladiator writes the legend.*
