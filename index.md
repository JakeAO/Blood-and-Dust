## The Premise

You are a gladiator in the Grand Arena of Obusia, a sprawling coastal city where blood sport is religion and survival is glory. Perhaps you were a slave sold into bondage, a criminal condemned to die for the crowd's amusement, a warrior captured in distant wars, or a desperate freeman who sold yourself for coin. However you arrived, the sand beneath your feet is now your home.

Your patron, a wealthy sponsor with political ambitions, has bought your contract. They promise freedom—if you survive long enough to earn it. Fight well, and you may win glory, coin, and perhaps your liberty. Fight poorly, and the arena sand will drink your blood.

But the arena holds more than combat. Rivalries burn hot between gladiatorial schools. Powerful sponsors vie for influence through their champions. And whispers speak of something ancient stirring beneath the colosseum stones—something that hungers for more than blood and spectacle.

## Atmosphere

- **Brutal Combat:** Sand-stained violence where every fight could be your last
- **Arena Politics:** Navigate rivalries between schools, earn crowd favor, and serve your patron's ambitions
- **Mythic Undertones:** Ancient powers, forgotten gods, and mysteries buried beneath the arena
- **Survival & Freedom:** Earn your way to liberty—or die trying

## System

This campaign uses **Mythras Imperative**, a percentile-based d100 system emphasizing tactical combat, special effects, and gritty realism. See the [Info section]({{ "/info/" | relative_url }}) for rules and resources.
