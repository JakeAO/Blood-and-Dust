**Role:** Lanista (Gladiator Trainer & Owner)

## Description
Tiberius is the owner and master of the Ludus Ferrata ("Iron School"), one of the most prominent gladiatorial training schools in Obusia. A former merchant who built his fortune through trade and calculated investments, he purchased the ludus fifteen years ago and transformed it into a profitable enterprise. He treats his gladiators as valuable assets—investments to be maintained, trained, and deployed strategically. While not needlessly cruel, he has no qualms about making examples of those who defy him or squandering lives when the profit margin justifies the loss.

## Appearance
- Stocky build with a prominent belly, showing the comfort of his wealth
- Clean-shaven with closely cropped gray hair, always immaculately groomed
- Wears fine tunics of deep purple and gold, often adorned with the emblem of his ludus: an iron fist grasping a laurel wreath
- Hands are soft and unblemished—he has never fought in the arena himself
- Always accompanied by at least two bodyguards and carries a polished walking stick of dark wood inlaid with silver

## Known Information
- **Location:** The Ludus Ferrata compound in Obusia's arena district; occasionally seen at the Grand Arena or in the private boxes of wealthy sponsors
- **Connections:** Maintains business relationships with multiple sponsors and arena officials; rumored to have connections within the city senate
- **Goals:** Profit and prestige—he seeks to elevate his ludus's reputation while maximizing returns on his gladiators
- **Influence:** Wealthy and well-connected, with the power to determine a gladiator's fate within his ludus: who fights, who trains, who lives in comfort, and who suffers

## Relationships
Tiberius keeps his gladiators at arm's length, preferring to work through his trainers and overseers. He observes training sessions from a balcony and makes decisions about matches based on performance records and betting odds. He is known to reward successful gladiators with better quarters, quality equipment, and even small luxuries—but these favors are always transactional, never personal.

Rumor suggests he has close ties to several high-ranking sponsors who supply him with promising fighters in exchange for shares in his ludus's profits. Some whisper that he owes his initial fortune to a single powerful patron, though he never speaks of his past before becoming a merchant.

## Public Reputation
- Known for running a profitable, well-organized ludus with good training facilities
- Respected among other lanistae for his business acumen
- Viewed by gladiators as fair but cold—he follows the rules but shows little compassion
- Stories circulate of gladiators who earned their freedom under his ownership, though such cases are rare
- Some say he has a "special arrangement" with certain arena officials that ensures favorable match scheduling
