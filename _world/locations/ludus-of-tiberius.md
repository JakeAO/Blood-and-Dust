**Type:** Ludus

## Overview
The Ludus of Tiberius stands in the shadow of Obusia's Grand Arena, a weathered compound of stone and iron where gladiators are forged. Run by the lanista Tiberius, it houses dozens of fighters—veterans, fresh recruits, and slaves bound to the sand. The ludus is home, prison, and battlefield all at once, where survival depends on skill, cunning, and the favor of the gods.

Though modest compared to the grand ludii of richer lanistae, Tiberius runs a disciplined operation. His fighters are well-fed, rigorously trained, and expected to bring honor to the school. Those who win earn better quarters and privileges; those who fail too often find themselves in desperate matches or sold to lesser schools.

## Atmosphere
- **Architecture:** High stone walls topped with iron spikes, a central sand-covered training yard, cells carved from stone blocks, a modest shrine to Mars and Fortuna
- **Sounds:** The clash of wooden practice weapons, grunts of exertion, the bark of trainers, chains rattling, the occasional prayer or song from the cells at night
- **Sensory Details:** Sweat and blood mixed with sand, the metallic tang of practice weapons, incense smoke from the shrine, the ever-present heat of the sun beating down on the training yard

## Notable Areas Within
### The Training Yard
The heart of the ludus, an open courtyard covered in coarse sand and ringed by stone walls. Here gladiators drill from dawn to dusk under the watchful eyes of the doctores (trainers). Wooden posts for striking practice stand alongside weapon racks holding dulled training weapons. Blood and sweat have stained the sand countless times.

### The Cells
Cramped stone chambers where most gladiators sleep, four or six to a room. Each cell has straw pallets, a small window high on the wall, and iron rings set into the stone for chains if needed. Veterans and favored fighters earn cells closer to the courtyard with better light and air.

### The Armory
A locked chamber where real weapons and armor are stored. Only Tiberius and his most trusted trainer have keys. The equipment ranges from well-maintained Roman steel to exotic weapons from distant lands, depending on each gladiator's fighting style.

### The Shrine
A small alcove near the entrance holds statues of Mars Ultor and Fortuna. Gladiators make offerings here before matches, praying for strength, skill, and luck. The shrine is tended by an old former gladiator who speaks little but accepts any offering with solemn nods.

### Tiberius's Quarters
A two-story section of the compound houses the lanista's private chambers, his office, and a meeting room where he negotiates with sponsors and arena officials. Gladiators are rarely invited here, and then only for serious matters.

### The Infirmary
A stuffy room with a handful of cots where wounded fighters recover under the care of a Greek physician named Alexios. The air smells of herbs, vinegar, and blood. Those too injured to fight rest here, hoping to heal before their value to Tiberius diminishes.

## Key NPCs
- **Tiberius:** The lanista who owns and operates the ludus. A former gladiator himself, he is stern but fair, demanding excellence from his fighters while ensuring they're equipped to survive. He has connections to several sponsors and carefully manages his reputation.
- **Gaius the Doctore:** The head trainer, a scarred veteran who drills fighters with brutal efficiency. He can spot weakness in any technique and has no patience for laziness or cowardice.
- **Alexios:** The Greek physician who tends the wounded. Quiet and methodical, he keeps gladiators alive to fight another day, though he makes dark jokes about how many times he's stitched the same man.
- **Old Decimus:** The former gladiator who tends the shrine. He won his freedom years ago but chose to stay, speaking only when necessary and always in riddles or proverbs.

## Significance
The ludus is the gladiators' entire world between matches. It is where they train, sleep, eat, and form bonds of brotherhood or rivalry. Every decision Tiberius makes affects their lives—which matches they fight, what equipment they receive, and whether they live as humans or mere property.

Rumors circulate among the fighters:
- Some say Tiberius is in debt to a powerful senator, which is why he pushes his gladiators so hard for victories
- There are whispers that one of the cells contains a secret passage used during the slave wars, though no one admits to finding it
- Veterans speak of fighters who earned their freedom from Tiberius, though such tales seem rare
- Word is that Tiberius once fought in the very arena the ludus serves, and his scars tell tales of battles that should have killed him

The ludus stands as both sanctuary and prison. To some, it is a path to glory and freedom. To others, it is simply the place where they will die in preparation for dying in the arena.
