## The Dice

Roll **d100 (percentile dice)**: Roll two ten-sided dice, one for tens and one for ones.
- Compare result to your skill rating
- Roll **equal to or under** your skill to succeed
- Lower is better; rolling doubles (11, 22, 33, etc.) can be critical or fumble

## Success Levels

- **Critical Success:** Roll doubles under your skill (e.g., 22 when skill is 55%)
- **Success:** Roll under your skill
- **Failure:** Roll over your skill  
- **Fumble:** Roll doubles over your skill (e.g., 77 when skill is 55%)

## Difficulty Grades

Difficulty modifies your skill rating:

| Grade | Modifier |
|-------|----------|
| Automatic | No roll needed |
| Very Easy | +40% |
| Easy | +20% |
| Standard | +0% |
| Hard | -20% |
| Formidable | -40% |
| Herculean | -60% |

## Core Mechanic

1. GM sets difficulty grade
2. Apply modifier to your skill percentage
3. Roll d100
4. If result ≤ modified skill: Success!

## Opposed Rolls

Both sides roll their skill:
- Both succeed: Higher roll wins (unless a critical)
- One succeeds: That side wins
- Both fail: Stalemate or GM decides

## Combat Basics

### Combat Actions

Each round you may take:
- **1 Action** (attack, cast spell, etc.)
- Up to **1 Proactive** Action (movement, ready weapon)
- Unlimited **Reactive** Actions (parry, evade)

### Attack Roll

1. Roll your combat skill (Close Combat, Unarmed, etc.)
2. Opponent chooses to Parry or Evade (rolls defense)
3. Compare success levels

### Special Effects

If you win an opposed roll and rolled better (not just succeeded), you gain a **Special Effect**:
- Offensive: Bypass Armor, Impale, Trip, etc.
- Defensive: Disarm, Riposte, Pin Weapon, etc.

Choose one from your style's available effects.

## Hit Locations

Roll d20 to determine hit location:

| d20 | Humanoid Location |
|-----|-------------------|
| 1-3 | Right Leg |
| 4-6 | Left Leg |
| 7-9 | Abdomen |
| 10-12 | Chest |
| 13-15 | Right Arm |
| 16-18 | Left Arm |
| 19-20 | Head |

Each location has hit points (usually SIZ+CON divided among locations) and armor.

## Damage & Wounds

- **Armor Points (AP):** Reduces damage
- **Hit Points per Location:** When reduced to 0 or below, location is wounded
- **Serious Wound:** Location at 0 HP or below
- **Major Wound:** Location at negative HP equal to its starting HP
