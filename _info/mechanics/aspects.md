# Passions & Reputation

## What Are Passions?

Passions represent deep emotional connections, beliefs, or loyalties that drive your character. They work like skills with a percentage rating.

**Examples:**
- *Love (Family)*
- *Loyalty (Ludus/School)*
- *Hate (Rival Gladiator)*
- *Honor (Personal Code)*

## Using Passions

### When to Roll Passions

Roll a passion when:
- Resisting manipulation related to that passion
- Acting against the passion's nature
- Pushing yourself beyond normal limits
- Gaining inspiration in dire circumstances

### Rolling a Passion

- **Success:** Gain +20% to one skill roll related to the passion
- **Critical:** Gain +40% and recover 1d3 HP to all locations
- **Failure:** No benefit, but no penalty
- **Fumble:** Temporarily overwhelmed; -20% to related actions

## Gaining & Losing Passions

### Gaining Passions
- Start with 1-3 passions (usually 40-60%)
- Develop new passions through play
- Increase through experience and roleplay

### Losing Passions
- Passions can decrease if betrayed or circumstances change
- Can be voluntarily suppressed or abandoned

## Reputation

Reputation measures how you're known by others. Track reputation separately for different groups:

**Examples:**
- *Arena Crowd*
- *Patrician Sponsors*  
- *Fellow Gladiators*
- *The Lanista (trainer)*

### Using Reputation

When interacting with those who know your reputation:
- Positive reputation: Easier social interactions, better treatment
- Negative reputation: Suspicion, poor treatment, hostility

The GM may grant bonuses or penalties to Influence and similar skills based on reputation.

### Building Reputation

Reputation grows through:
- Spectacular victories in the arena
- Heroic or cowardly actions
- Gossip and rumor
- Repeated behavior patterns
