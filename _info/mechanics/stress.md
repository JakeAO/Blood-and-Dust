## Hit Locations

Every character has seven hit locations, each with its own Hit Points and armor:

| d20 Roll | Location | Typical HP* |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| 1-3 | Right Leg | 5 |
| 4-6 | Left Leg | 5 |
| 7-9 | Abdomen | 6 |
| 10-12 | Chest | 7 |
| 13-15 | Right Arm | 4 |
| 16-18 | Left Arm | 4 |
| 19-20 | Head | 5 |

*HP varies by character (based on SIZ and CON)

## Taking Damage

When hit:
1. **Roll damage** for the weapon
2. **Subtract armor** points (AP) from damage
3. **Apply remaining damage** to the hit location
4. **Check wound severity**

### Wound Severity

- **No Wound:** Location still has HP remaining
- **Serious Wound:** Location reduced to 0 HP or below
- **Major Wound:** Location at negative HP equal to its starting value

## Wound Effects

### Serious Wound
- Location is incapacitated (limb useless, torso/head causes shock)
- **Endurance roll** or suffer immediate penalties
- **Bleeding:** Lose 1 HP per round from location until treated

### Major Wound  
- Devastating injury (limb severed, organ damage, skull fracture)
- Character may be dying or unconscious
- **Immediate Endurance roll** at -20% or fall unconscious
- Requires advanced medical care

### Location-Specific Effects

**Limb (Arm/Leg):**
- Serious: Limb unusable
- Major: Limb severed or shattered

**Abdomen/Chest:**
- Serious: Winded, -2 to all actions
- Major: Internal bleeding, dying

**Head:**
- Serious: Stunned, -4 to all actions  
- Major: Unconscious, potentially fatal

## First Aid & Healing

### First Aid
- **Skill roll** to stabilize bleeding and wounds
- **Success:** Stops bleeding, +1d3 HP to location
- Takes 1d3 minutes

### Natural Healing
- **Healing Rate:** CON / 5 HP per week
- Serious wounds require medical care before healing
- Major wounds take months to heal (if they heal at all)

### Magical Healing
If magic is present in your game, healing spells can accelerate recovery.
