# Combat Actions in Mythras

In Mythras Imperative, each combat round you can take different types of actions based on the situation.

## Action Types

### Proactive Actions (1 per round)
Actions that don't directly oppose an enemy:
- **Movement** — Move up to your movement rate
- **Ready/Change Weapon** — Draw, sheath, or swap weapons
- **Mount/Dismount** — Get on or off a mount
- **Take Cover** — Move into defensive position
- **Cast Spell** — Prepare and cast magic (if applicable)

### Action (1 per round)
Your main combat action:
- **Attack** — Strike an opponent with a weapon or unarmed
- **Charge** — Move and attack in one action (specific conditions)
- **Outmaneuver** — Reposition to gain advantage
- **Change Range** — Close in or withdraw from melee

### Reactive Actions (unlimited)
Defensive responses to enemy actions:
- **Parry** — Block attack with weapon or shield
- **Evade** — Dodge out of harm's way
- **Interrupt** — Counter an opponent's action (if you win Initiative)

## Combat Round Sequence

1. **Declaration** — Declare intended actions
2. **Initiative** — Compare Initiative values (highest acts first)
3. **Resolution** — Resolve actions in Initiative order
4. **End of Round** — Effects expire, new round begins

## Making an Attack

1. **Roll** your combat skill (Close Combat, Unarmed, etc.)
2. **Defender** chooses to Parry or Evade and rolls
3. **Compare** success levels:
   - Both succeed: Higher roll wins
   - One succeeds: That side wins
   - Both fail: Attack misses

## Special Effects

If you win an opposed roll **AND** roll better than your opponent (not just barely win), you gain a **Special Effect**. Choose one from your style:

### Offensive Effects
- **Bypass Armor** — Ignore armor on this hit
- **Impale** — Weapon stuck, causes ongoing damage
- **Maximize Damage** — Roll maximum weapon damage
- **Trip Opponent** — Knock foe prone

### Defensive Effects  
- **Disarm Opponent** — Force foe to drop weapon
- **Riposte** — Free immediate counterattack
- **Pin Weapon** — Trap opponent's weapon
