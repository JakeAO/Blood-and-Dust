## What is Sponsor Favor?

As gladiators fighting in the Grand Arena, you are owned by wealthy patrician sponsors who have invested in your training, equipment, and fights. **Favor** represents your standing with your sponsor—their satisfaction with your performance, their willingness to invest in your success, and ultimately, your path to freedom.

Favor is tracked as a numerical value that rises and falls based on your actions in and out of the arena. High Favor brings rewards and opportunities; low Favor brings scrutiny and risk.

## Gaining Favor

Your sponsor rewards excellence and anything that advances their political ambitions. You gain Favor through:

### Arena Performance

**Victory and Spectacle**
- Winning fights, especially in dramatic fashion
- Performing special combat maneuvers (trips, disarms, acrobatics)
- Showing courage against overwhelming odds
- Granting mercy to defeated opponents (showing honor)
- Surviving against dangerous beasts or legendary opponents

**Crowd Reactions**
- Spectacular kills or finishing moves
- Theatrical combat that thrills the audience
- Building a recognizable persona or fighting style
- Responding to crowd chants and demands

### Advancing Your Sponsor's Goals

- Representing them well at social functions
- Defeating rivals from competing houses
- Winning high-profile matches that boost their reputation
- Gathering useful information or political leverage
- Following their instructions, even difficult ones

### Roleplay Opportunities

Don't be afraid to ask your GM if an action might earn Favor! Examples:
- Training a new gladiator from your sponsor's stable
- Showing loyalty during a difficult situation
- Proposing creative solutions to problems
- Making personal sacrifices for the ludus (gladiator school)

## Losing Favor

Your sponsor's patience is not infinite. You lose Favor through:

### Poor Performance

- Losing fights, especially in humiliating fashion
- Cowardice in the arena
- Surrendering too quickly
- Displeasing the crowd with boring combat
- Injuring yourself through careless mistakes

### Dishonor and Misconduct

- Defying your sponsor's direct orders
- Causing scandal that reflects poorly on your patron
- Damaging their property or reputation
- Fighting with other gladiators in your ludus
- Illegal gambling or other forbidden activities

### Political Complications

- Actions that harm your sponsor's political rivals might cost you Favor if those rivals are powerful
- Being caught in schemes without your sponsor's knowledge
- Associating with enemies of your patron

## Spending Favor

High Favor isn't just for show—you can spend it to gain advantages:

### Equipment and Resources

- Request better weapons or armor for an upcoming fight
- Access to healing potions or medical care beyond basic treatment
- Training time with specialized weapon masters

### Social Capital

- Attend patrician social events (networking opportunities)
- Request your sponsor's influence in solving a problem
- Gain an audience with important NPCs
- Bring concerns or requests to your sponsor's attention

### Arena Advantages

- Influence match-ups to face preferred opponents
- Request specific arena conditions or terrain
- Gain advance knowledge of your opponent's fighting style
- Choose your entrance music or costume

### The Ultimate Prize: Freedom

At very high Favor levels, you may become eligible for the **rudis**—the wooden sword symbolizing your freedom from bondage. This is the dream of every gladiator, but earning it requires sustained excellence, unwavering loyalty, and surviving long enough to prove your worth.

Your GM will let you know when you're approaching rudis eligibility.

## Living with Favor

### Track Your Standing

Pay attention to your Favor score. Your GM will inform you when significant changes occur and give you a general sense of your sponsor's mood:
- Very pleased
- Satisfied
- Neutral
- Concerned
- Displeased

### Plan Ahead

If you need something important, consider:
- Building Favor before making a big request
- Timing requests after major victories
- Understanding what your sponsor values most

### Take Risks

Don't hoard Favor endlessly. Sometimes spending Favor on the right equipment or opportunity can lead to even greater success. Bold gladiators who seize opportunities often rise faster than cautious ones.

### Serve Multiple Goals

The best gladiators find ways to serve their own ambitions while also advancing their sponsor's interests. Freedom and glory await those clever enough to make their goals align with their patron's.

**Remember:** Your sponsor wants you to succeed—but only on their terms. Win glory, entertain the crowds, advance their political standing, and earn your freedom one fight at a time.

*Blood and dust, honor and coin.*
